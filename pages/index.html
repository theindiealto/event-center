  <div class="quote">	&#34;I hosted a local craft fair at the community center and couldn&#39;t have asked for a better experience! The staff was incredibly helpful, the space was clean and well-equipped, and we had a great turnout thanks to their help promoting the event. It felt like the whole neighborhood showed up! I&#39;m already planning my next one.&#34;<br><strong>— Jess M., local artisan and event organizer</strong></div>
